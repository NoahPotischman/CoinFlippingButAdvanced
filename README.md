# CoinFlippingButAdvanced
CoinFlipper: This is a python program that creates a threaded python coinflipper and records various performance metrics about said coin flips. These results will be saved to a file and sent to a discord webhook.

Coinflipdatascraper: This is a python program that reads all the data that has been generated by the coinflipper, then saved to a txt file, and returns the longest streak of heads/tails, then sends said data to a discord webhook.

! Please note !
By default, the CoinFlipper contains the coinflipdatascraper automatically intergrated. Once you finish generating the coinflips and the data is sent, you will be prompted with a question about if you want the session data sent or not. I will all include the scraper seperately. 

When a coin is flipped, there is a 50/50 chance that it lands on either side. If a coin is flipped and lands on heads, there is still a 50% chance the coin will land on heads again. But, that is only after the coin is flipped. Before the coin is ever flipped, there is a 50% chance it will land on heads the first time, and a 25% chance that it will land on heads, then heads again. The calculation for the probability can be done by doing (0.5 ^ x) 0.5 repersents 50%, which are the chances of the coin landing on either side, and x is equal to whatever the longest streak is. ex (0.5 ^ 2) = 0.25(100) = 25%

The metrics calculated and saved include:

  Overall:
Total Flips
Flips per Second
Average Time per Flip
Total Heads
Total Tails
Flip Count Standard Deviation
Heads Percentage Variance
Tails Percentage Variance
Longest Heads Streak
Longest Tails Streak
Duration (spent flipping)

  Streak Specific:
Probability of Longest Heads Streak (This contains both scientific notation and fraction formatting)
Probability of Longest Tails Streak (This contains both scientific notation and fraction formatting)

  Random: 
Request metadata (This includes the username of the person who generated the instance, which they are prompted to provide before any data is saved, as well as the date and time of the generation)

A typical generation would look like this:

CoinFlipDataScraper: This scrapes the CoinFlipper's performance metrics and returns data about the longest coin flip streak out of all the streaks in the data file

The metrics calculated and saved include:
  Overall:
The longest Heads streak from the most recent session
The longest Tails streak from the most recent session is

  Random:

How to install:
1. Download the CoinFlipper.py file
2. Search for the word "change" and go to all the places where it says change/replace this with that. You should have to change 2 discord webhooks and 3 file location paths.
3. Run the file and get your results.
