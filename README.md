CoinFlippingButAdvanced
An advanced python program that flips coins and calculates various performance metrics about the coin flips. This program consists of two parts: CoinFlipper and CoinFlipDataScraper.

CoinFlipper
CoinFlipper is a threaded python program that generates and records various performance metrics about the coin flips. The results are saved to a file and sent to a Discord webhook.

By default, the CoinFlipper includes the CoinFlipDataScraper integrated. After the coin flips are generated and the data is sent, you will be prompted with a question about whether you want the session data sent or not. The scraper can also be included separately.

The metrics calculated and saved include:

Overall:
Total Flips
Flips per Second
Average Time per Flip
Total Heads
Total Tails
Flip Count Standard Deviation
Heads Percentage Variance
Tails Percentage Variance
Longest Heads Streak
Longest Tails Streak
Duration (spent flipping)
Streak Specific:
Probability of Longest Heads Streak (with both scientific notation and fraction formatting)
Probability of Longest Tails Streak (with both scientific notation and fraction formatting)
Random:
Request metadata (including the username of the person who generated the instance, the date and time of the generation)
A typical generation would look like this:

CoinFlipDataScraper
CoinFlipDataScraper is a python program that reads all the data generated by the CoinFlipper and returns the longest streak of heads/tails. The data is then sent to a Discord webhook.

The metrics calculated and saved include:

Overall:
The longest Heads streak from the most recent session
The longest Tails streak from the most recent session
Random:
Request metadata (including the date and time of the request)
A typical generation would look like this:

Installation
Download the CoinFlipper.py file
Search for the word "change" and go to all the places where it says "change/replace this with that." You will need to change two Discord webhooks and three file location paths.
Run the file and get your results.
Note: When a coin is flipped, there is a 50/50 chance that it will land on either side. The probability of a coin landing on heads after a heads flip can be calculated using (0.5^x), where 0.5 represents 50% (the chances of the coin landing on either side), and x is equal to the longest streak.
